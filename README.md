# StreamIt

A web application to search for movies and TV shows and find where you can stream them.

Deployed project can be viewed at https://findstream.netlify.app/

If you'd like to run the project locally, you will need an API key from https://rapidapi.com/
In vue/src/services/StreamingService.js, replace API_KEY with your own key.

Pull to your local machine, open the terminal in the root directory of the project and run 
  "npm install"
  "npm run serve"

In the future I hope to add authorization to allow users to log in and save movies they have found and create a watchlist.
